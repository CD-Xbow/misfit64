This is the README file for Maverick Model 3D

Maverick Model 3D is a 3D model editor.  It was written and tested on Linux.
It is reported to run on other Unix-like operating systems. It also runs
on Windows. See INSTALL.WIN32 for Windows-specific instructions.

It is based on Misfit Model 3D that was developed by Kevin Worcester from 2004
to 2009. Maverick Model 3D is maintained by Zack Middleton (zturtleman).

Maverick Model 3D requires Qt (5.x) and OpenGL support.  See the INSTALL file
for details on where to get these packages.

This program uses autoconf and automake for building from source.  What this
means is that if you are lucky you can install this program with these
easy steps:

   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

This will build a 'mm3d' executable and install it in /usr/local/bin.
Documentation will be in /usr/local/share/doc/mm3d.

For more detailed installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.
See INSTALL.WIN32 for Windows-specific instructions.

## Debian/Ubuntu

Build dependencies:

    sudo apt install autoconf automake make gcc g++ qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qttools5-dev-tools libgl1-mesa-dev

## Fedora

Build dependencies:

    sudo dnf install autoconf automake make gcc gcc-c++ qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-linguist mesa-libGLU-devel

## macOS

On macOS 10.11+, install homebrew from http://brew.sh and run the following
commands.

   brew install autoconf automake qt
   ./autogen.sh
   CXX='clang++ -stdlib=libc++' ./configure --with-Qt-dir=/usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.11.1 --with-macosx-version-min=10.11
   make
   make mm3d.app

This will build a 'Maverick Model 3D.app' AppBundle. (macosx-version-min is
copied from /usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.11.1/mkspecs/macx-clang/qmake.conf)
