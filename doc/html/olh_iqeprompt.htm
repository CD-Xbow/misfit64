      <h1>IQE Export Options</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>IQE Export Options</b> window is displayed when you save
      a model in Inter-Quake Export (IQE) format. It allows you to specify
      things like whether or not to save the bone joints in the file and
      which animations to save.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Save as a Quake 3 Player</b> checkbox allows you indicate
      if you want to export as a Quake 3 composite player model
      (head.iqe, upper.iqe, and lower.iqe models).
      If it is grayed out, see the list of requirements for export on the <a href="olh_quakemd3.html">MD3</a> page.
      </p>

      <p>
      For exporting as a Quake 3 player, there must be a root joint with a desendent torso joint and desendent (of torso joint) head joint. There must be a "tag_torso" point at the exact location of the torso joint and attached to the torso joint. Same for "tag_head" at exact location of head joint and attached to it. The point names must be "tag_torso" and "tag_head", the joint names can be anything. Do not make the root joint be the torso joint; everything will be a desendent of it and there cannot be leg joints.
      </p>

      <p>
      Joints/points that are not a desendents of torso joint are exported in lower.iqe. Torso joint and desendent joints/points to (and including) head joint and "tag_head" point are exported to upper.iqe. Head joint and desendent joints/points are exported to head.iqe.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Save Quake 3 animation.cfg</b> checkbox allows you to indicate
      if you want to write "animation.cfg" file along side the model.
      This file contains a list of animations with looping and frames
      per-second information and can contain other arbitry data from
      MD3_CFG_* meta data. See the <a href="olh_quakemd3.html">MD3</a> page for details.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Save Meshes</b> checkbox allows you indicate if you want
      the meshes saved in the file or not.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Save Points as Bone Joints</b> checkbox allows you to indicate
      if you want the <a href="olh_pointdetails.html">points</a> to be saved
      as skeleton bone joints or not at all. Points can only have one bone
      joint influence. "Save Skeleton" or "Save Animations" must also be
      checked.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Save Skeleton</b> checkbox allows you to indicate if you want
      the bone joints saved in the file or not.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Save Animations</b> checkbox allows you to indicate if you want
      animations saved in the file or not.
      </p>

      <p>
      The animations list box allows you to specify which animations you want
      to be saved in the file.
      </p>

      <p>
      Click <b>Ok</b> to save the model with the specified
      options or click <b>Cancel</b> to ignore any changes.
      </p>
