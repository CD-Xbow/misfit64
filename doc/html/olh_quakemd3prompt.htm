      <h1>MD3 Export Options</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>MD3 Export Options</b> window is displayed when you save
      a model in Quake MD3 format. See <a href="olh_quakemd3.html">Quake MD3</a>
      for more details about player models and animation.cfg.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Save as a Player Model</b> checkbox allows you indicate
      if you want to export as a Quake 3 composite player model
      (head.md3, upper.md3, and lower.md3 models).
      If it is grayed out, see the list of requirements for export on the MD3 page.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Save animation.cfg</b> checkbox allows you to indicate
      if you want to write "animation.cfg" file along side the model.
      This file contains a list of animations with looping and frames
      per-second information and can contain other arbitry data from
      MD3_CFG_* meta data.
      </p>

      <p>
      Click <b>Ok</b> to save the model with the specified
      options or click <b>Cancel</b> to ignore any changes.
      </p>
