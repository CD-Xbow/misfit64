      <h1>Plugins Window</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>Plugins Window</b> shows you what plugins are installed and active.
      </p>

      Plugins can add support for additional features, see
      <a href="olh_develop.html#plugins">Development &sect; Plugins</a>
      for details.

      <p>
      Plugins are located in a directory on your hard drive.
      Plugins can be in subdirectories or symbolic links.

      Using the Flatpak on Linux, Maverick Model 3D uses

      </li>
      <li>
      On macOS, Maverick Model 3D uses <code>$HOME/Library/Application Support/Maverick Model 3D/plugins/1.3</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
      On other Unix-like systems, Maverick Model 3D uses <code>$HOME/.mm3d/plugins/1.3</code>

      be changed at compile time.
      </li>

      </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      The main component of the plugins window is a table that contains
      a list of plugins.  Each plugin should also provide a <b>Version</b> string
      and a <b>Description</b> string.  There is also a <b>Status</b> column that tells you
      if the plugin is properly initialized and currently active. <b>Filename</b> specifies
      the full path of the plugin.
      </p>

      <p>
      All plugins can be disabled at run time by specifying <code>--no-plugins</code> 
      on the command line.  Specific plugins can be disabled by specifying
      <code>--no-plugin=<i>plugin_name</i></code> on the command line.  
      <code>--no-plugin</code> can be specified more than once.
