      <h1>Offset by Normal Window</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>Offset by Normal Window</b> is used to interactively move the
      selected vertices along the vertex normal.  This only affects
      vertices that are connected to a triangle.
      It is made up of a text entry box for the max distance with a slider
      and a text entry box for the percent value.
      </p>

      <p>
      The vertex normal is the averaged direction of connected triangles.
      It is not affected by the group smoothing and max angle.
      </p>

      <p>
      The offset to move the selected vertexes is calculated by the
      max distance scaled by the percent value. The percent value slider
      allows for better interactivity.
      </p>

      <p>
      The max distance is the value to move when the slider is set to 100%.
      </p>

      <p>
      The percent value ranges from -100 to 100 and starts at 0.  
      A value of zero is the starting shape of the selected
      mesh.
      You can drag the slider left to decrease the value, or drag it right to 
      increase the value.  You can also change the value by typing a new
      value into the text box next to the slider.
